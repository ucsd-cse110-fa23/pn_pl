## Instructions
To start the application, run `app/src/main/java/ui/Main.java` with the libraries in `app/lib`. You can do this by using VSCode's built-in Java runner, and running the configuration entitled `UI`. 

Additionally, make sure the address in `server_url.txt` matches the address of the backend server. To run the server locally, you can start the `Server` configuration in VSCode.

## Tests
To run tests, simply run `./gradlew build`.
